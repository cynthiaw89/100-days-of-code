# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 21st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed Flexbox on project #3, did some general layout and styling with CSS. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel a lot more comfortable with flexbox which is helping with my confidence.

### Day 2: July 22nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished project #3 and made everything prettier (still very much ugly).  I figured out border and background gradients, fixed positions, and got lots of practice in finding the misspelled tag.

**Thoughts:** I feel like even though I completed the project, I didn't accomplish a whole lot.  I'm itching to move on to new topics, but I know I need to ensure I have enough base knowledge to not overwhelm myself later.
