# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 21st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed Flexbox on project #3, did some general layout and styling with CSS. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel a lot more comfortable with flexbox which is helping with my confidence.

### Day 2: July 22nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished project #3 and made everything prettier (still very much ugly).  I figured out border and background gradients, fixed positions, and got lots of practice in finding the misspelled tag.

**Thoughts:** I feel like even though I completed the project, I didn't accomplish a whole lot.  I'm itching to move on to new topics, but I know I need to ensure I have enough base knowledge to not overwhelm myself later.

**Later Edit:** Decided to code some more, finished project #4!!! I'm feeling pretty good.

### Day 3: July 23rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started on Project #5.  Layout is pretty much done.

**Thoughts:** I have no style.  I'm bad at colors.  I wish I had specific instructions on what colors to use, how to style, etc.  I can do the coding, it's deciding what to code that's the issue.

### Day 4: July 24th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made some progress on Project #5.  I could add a bassic media query and submit it right now, but it wouldn't feel done.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit better about the design stuff.  Practice will hopefully allow me to build my own style.  I'm also looking forward to the backend stuff and some computer science audit courses I've signed up for.  I'm wondering if machine learning might be my end goal... Time will tell.  For now I've started reading Your First Year in Code by Isaac Lyman and I'm finding it really interesting.

### Day 5: July 25th, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Thursday- Finished another chapter of First Year in Code.  Had a few laughs.
Finished project 5, It looks… okay.  I was kind of just ready to be done with it, so I sent it through for my cert, which I got!  Responsive Web Design or something.  I spent most of today working through SCIP, and didn't get through section 1.1 yet.  

**Thoughts:** The text is a difficult read for me.  It's been so long since I've dealt with logic, I feel like I lost a lot of my mental acuity.  It further cements that I should be doing this though.  If I don't exercise my mind soon, I won't have much of one left as I get older.  Hopefully after a couple of months of continuous study, I'll start picking things up quickly again.  I don't think it will ever be as easy as it was when I was younger, but that's okay.  I can't go back into the past.  Time to keep moving forward.  
I'm a little burnt out on SCIP exercises tonight, I'm going to move onto my zero to mastery course that I haven’t touched in about a week.  I'll probably also work through some free code camp stuff.  Time for some javascript!

### Day 7: July 27th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched some ZtM tutorials and coded along a bit.

**Thoughts:** This is starting to feel a bit repetitive, but there are nuggets of excellence that I don't want to miss.  Only spent a little over an hour on this today.  SPent a lot of time with my family and went out to an arcade.

**Link to work:** N/a, they were just coding exercises.

### Day 8: July 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday.  

**Thoughts:** Didn't do too much again.  Had a lot of housework to complete and it was DnD night.  Did some tutorials between housework and about an hour after DnD at like 1am.

**Link to work:** N/A again.

### Day 9: July 29th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Lots of tutorials, moving through javascript. Mainly went through freecodecamp.  

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel like I remember javascript.
